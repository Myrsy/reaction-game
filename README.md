# Reaction game 

This is a project for the course TIE-02101 Programming 1: Introduction (Summer 2020).

## How to play?

The project is a reaction game with a login screen and a scoreboard window. 
The game consists of a specific number of labels that change colors to either red, blue, green, or white. 
The player has to press the corresponding number on the keyboard as soon as the green label appears. 

The score awarded will be based on the time elapsed between the color change and the pressing of the number. 
Hence, a smaller score is better.
If the player presses a number with the wrong color, +1 extra point will be added.
