# Object opens the game window that contains the number of labels with text
# 1,2,...,n where n is the number of labels defined in oma_projekti.py file.
# Window also shows instructions on how to play.
# After two seconds, when the start_button is pressed, the labels will
# change colors. Colors will disappear if the player presses any key on
# keyboard. Colors will then appear after two seconds. This repeats as many
# times as it is defined in oma_projekti.py file.
